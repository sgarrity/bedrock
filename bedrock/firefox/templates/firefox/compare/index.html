          Your browser is your gateway to the Internet. Speed, security, privacy and utility are important to most people. For a long time, one browser in particular was ahead. But at a time when online ads seem to know us better than we know ourselves, fake news gets around faster than a cold in an open-plan office, and data breaches are constantly making into the nightly news, most people simply expect more from a browser. And rightly so.

          Especially when it comes to privacy and security, most people no longer want to fall victim to a business model based on collecting and selling vast amounts of their data. So they say: Compare browsers and find out where Google Chrome and Firefox, Safari and Opera, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge actually differ from each other. Is there one, best browser ever? It helps to take a closer look at three areas: Privacy, utility and portability.
